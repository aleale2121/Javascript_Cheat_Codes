// Only primitive values, like number,
// and references to objects are protected from change. The actual object that
// the reference refers to does not receive any protection from the use of const.


// JavaScript const is like final in Java and readonly in C#â€”all of these protect only
// primitives and references


// To make a reference immutable, use const. However, to make an object itself
// immutable, we need some additional help from JavaScript. see the next js file
